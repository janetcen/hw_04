4. **I believe that I've completed the required tasks, Credit 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, and 7 (both parts); did NOT complete Credit 5 (Bot Army) and Markovify. My estimated score is 34/30. However, withour the comments on the banned r/BotTown, my score would be 32/30 as I completed Credit 1, 2, 4, 6, and 7 (both pars).**
