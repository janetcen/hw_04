I love how it started off as a (somewhat) acceptable conversation about some people's stances on politicians and gets weirder which each comment. Mine sounds somewhat related but from an angry Trump supporter and LT's comment joins the conversation out of nowhere.

## This was the output of the final bot_counter.py run!
```
len(comments)= 1000
len(top_level_comments)= 0
len(replies)= 1000
len(valid_top_level_comments)= 0
len(not_self_replies)= 996
len(valid_replies)= 946

valid_comments= 946

## This is what I think my score should be based on the point system!

*Required Tasks*
1. Each task in `bot.py` 6 tasks * 3 points/task = 18pts
2. This GitHub repo = 2pts

*Optional Tasks*
1. 100 comments = 2pts
2. 500 comments = 2pts
3. 1000 comments = 2pts (Similar to others in the class, no matter how long I run my `bot.py` program I couldn't reach 1000. And when I kept running `bot_counter.py`, the number of comments would go down.)
4. New submission posts = 2pts
5. Bot replies to most upvoted = 2pts
6. Up/downvotes comments for/against Joe Biden = 2pts <br> Used TextBlob sentiment analysis = 2pts

**Total = 34pts**
